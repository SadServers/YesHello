# Yes Hello Me

Some people have [no hello](https://nohello.net/) as Slack status or they enter that site when someone reaches out to them with just a "Hi!" or "Hello".  

That is fine. Being effective and all.  

Somebody may think it's a bit passive-aggressive. 

Do whatever you want; say hello if you want to first, don’t say hello if you don’t want to and get right into it.

But please **be kind**.

That's all.
